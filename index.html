    <h1>Operation Doda – The Great Helmet Heist</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Subject:</strong> Operation Doda – The Great Helmet Heist<br>
    <strong>Date:</strong> 11 November, Yammu Standard Time</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>At approximately 2:42 PM, the Chairman’s Limited-Edition Polo Helmet — a sacred artifact containing encrypted coordinates, vintage malt aroma, and classified polo strategies — was reported missing from headquarters.</p>
      <p>The Chairman himself remained composed and radiant, simply stating:<br>
      <em>“Find it before sunset. I have martinis waiting on Mars.”</em></p>
      <p>Panic ensued everywhere else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Chronology of Events</h2>
      <h3>1) Emergency Briefing (HQ – Hall of Confusion)</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>CEO Tak activated Code Duggar Red (“Everyone look serious”).</li>
        <li>MD Verma nervously opened Excel.</li>
        <li>Chairman Puri, calm as ever, sipped his single malt and signaled phase one: <em>Divine Observation Mode</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Arrival of the Alien Asset</h3>
      <p>Pan Dea Chmyar — codename Khota X9 — descended from the rooftop antenna array, wearing sunglasses and a misplaced sense of confidence.</p>
      <p>He announced: <em>“Target located — Doda sector, near a bakery. Coordinates confirmed via pickle-jar triangulation.”</em></p>

      <h3>3) Field Deployment</h3>
      <p>The trio — Tak, Verma, and Chmyar — departed on CEO Tak’s vintage <strong>Lambretta scooter</strong>, registration <span class="mono">YMU-420</span>.<br>
      Verma demanded a “research detour” through Samba (sampled samosas for morale).<br>
      Chmyar requested permission to “slap for truth,” which was silently approved by a committee of one (himself).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Chole Pathure Slap Incident (Doda Main Bazaar)</h2>
      <p>While searching for Bakery No. 3, the team stopped a man eating chole pathure. CEO Tak politely asked for directions. The man, still chewing, said, “Nahi pata bhaiya.”</p>
      <p><strong>Laffad #1</strong> was deployed. Chmyar raised his mighty hand and delivered a precision strike across the man’s cheek: <em>“How dare you not know your own city! The bakery is right behind you!”</em></p>
      <p>The stunned man dropped his plate, turned around — and indeed, there it was. Trembling, he stammered, “Sorry sir… I am not from Yammu, I am from Bihar.”</p>
      <p>At which point MD Verma executed <strong>Laffad #2</strong> and thundered: <em>“Phosdi de! You came to Yammu without a No-Objection Certificate from Chairman Sahab? Report to DuggarCorp Immigration immediately!”</em></p>
      <p>Local witnesses clapped. The man apologized again and offered his remaining chole pathure as tribute.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Doda Discovery</h2>
      <p>The bakery was raided. Helmet found beneath stale pastries, glowing faintly and playing Dogri folk remix in C minor.</p>
      <p>Inside was a handwritten note: <em>“Loyalty Test Complete. Congratulations, Barely. – Chairman Puri.”</em></p>
      <p>Tak saluted, Verma posed for a selfie, and Chmyar saluted the helmet twice — once for Yammu, once for the Chairman’s glory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Duggar Tolo and Polo Club (DTPC)</h2>
      <p>All top DuggarCorp decisions are made inside the hallowed halls of the <strong>Duggar Tolo and Polo Club (DTPC)</strong> — a 100% subsidiary of DuggarCorp. It is the elite hangout where Yammu’s finest tolos and bandars come to learn polo, refine Duggar etiquette, and absorb top-tier strategy directly from Chairman Puri.</p>
      <p>The club’s security is airtight, managed by <strong>Clerk Heera</strong>, the Junior Nightwatchman in Charge, commanding a battalion of <strong>10,843 Bandars</strong>. Not even a mosquito enters without a pass counter-signed by the Chairman.</p>
      <p>While DTPC carries a rich legacy of “Duggar Desh De Tolo Khelde Polo,” it also doubles as a luxurious resort for the Chairman’s personal pursuits. Chairman Puri often spends evenings scuba-diving, golfing, or sampling fine IPAs brewed in the club’s own brewery — a craft line so refined it’s exported under the label <em>“Yammu Yeast Reserve.”</em></p>
      <p>The club regularly hosts global icons and strategic partners: President Trump, Elon Musk, Satya Naddela, Judge Katil Banjara, Bob Cristo the Conman, and the top smuggler mitrons from France — all attending for the Chairman’s blessings and instruction in Duggar-style leadership, smuggling ethics, and interplanetary negotiation.</p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Helmet recovered (minor gravy contamination).</li>
        <li>Bakery nationalized for two hours.</li>
        <li>Incident reframed as “Anti-Pastry Intelligence Operation.”</li>
        <li>Chairman Puri commended the team for “swift loyalty and controlled slapping.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>“Remember, loyalty may slap — but never stumbles. When in doubt, investigate bakeries. Never leadership.”</em></p>
